This is an experiment at reproducing [Oskar Stålberg](https://oskarstalberg.com)'s amazing [Townscaper](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1291340/Townscaper). It was developped for educational purpose only, leading to the following Twitter threads:

 - [Twitter thread 01](https://twitter.com/exppad/status/1261950965189672961)
 - [Twitter thread 02](https://twitter.com/exppad/status/1267045322116734977)
 - [Twitter thread 03](https://twitter.com/exppad/status/1283520023798198273)

This study of the [WFC](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) algorithm eventually led me to develop [MesoGen](https://eliemichel.github.io/MesoGen/).
